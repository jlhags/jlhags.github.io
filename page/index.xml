I began programming when I was 12 years old. My family didn&amp;rsquo;t have much money. So, the only computer we had was an old Commodore 64 that our aunt gave us. I somehow managed to fry the serial port, which meant no external storage would work. The only thing I could do with it was program in BASIC. Luckily, it came with a book on how to do just that.</description></item></channel></rss>
