But thus far, all the examples have been fairly linear. What if we want do things only when certain criteria are met? Or what if we want to do the same thing many times in a row? What if we want want store a bunch of a rectangles from the previous lesson? This is where control structures, arrays and slices come in handy.</description></item><item><title>Beginning Programming Lesson 03</title><link>https://theoreticallyjosh.com/post/beginning-programming-lesson-03/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2022 09:03:18 -0700</pubDate><author>jlhags+blog@gmail.com (Joshua Hagofsky)</author><guid>https://theoreticallyjosh.com/post/beginning-programming-lesson-03/</guid><description>In the last installment of this series we learned about variables, and covered some simple variable types. Now we are going to learn about complex data types. In short, they store more than a single data point of information. For example, what if we wanted to have a variable that stored information about a rectangle? There is more than one bit of information to describe it. At minimum you would probably want to store its width and length.</description></item><item><title>Beginning Programming Lesson 02</title><link>https://theoreticallyjosh.com/post/beginning-programming-lesson-02/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2022 09:22:40 -0700</pubDate><author>jlhags+blog@gmail.com (Joshua Hagofsky)</author><guid>https://theoreticallyjosh.com/post/beginning-programming-lesson-02/</guid><description>Now that you have your setup ready to go, we can start writing some code! Note that we are just touching the surface of the topics covered in this lesson, but the sooner you start writing code, the easier it will become to understand the topics better. Plus you are more likely to continue, if you feel like you are accomplishing something, rather than learning more and more theory.

Without going into all the details, I broke it, and all that it would then let you do is write programs in BASIC. It came with a book explaining how to do various things with the language. So having nothing better to do, I worked through it and taught myself how to code, and eventually went to college to learn how to do it better.</description></item></channel></rss>
