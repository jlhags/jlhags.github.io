description: "About Josh Hagofsky. How and why I started programming"
---
My name is Joshua (Josh) Hagofsky. I began programming when I was 12 years old. My family didn't have much money. So, the only computer we had was an old [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) that our aunt gave us. I somehow managed to fry the serial port, which meant no external storage would work. The only thing I could do with it was program in BASIC. Luckily, it came with a book on how to do just that. I would spend ours trying to create simple programs and games, only to loose everything ever time I turned it off. Eventually in high school I began learning C. I was then approached by some teachers to see if I could write some voting software for a mock election. It worked, but looking back, the code was terrible. Anyway I went to college and learned how to get better.

Since then, I have worked on various projects for the US Military, NASA, Vonage, and American Express. Now I am the Director of Software for a patent analytics company, Ontologics. I my time working in these places I have learned a lot, in no small part thanks to the Internet. I now would like to return the favor by sharing my knowledge with others.
